Coding Question: 

AI in Healthcare: 

Write a Python program that simulates an AI model for medical image analysis. Use a simple machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) to predict whether a simulated medical image contains a tumor or not. Follow these steps: 

Simulate medical image data (e.g., pixel values) using random arrays. 

Train a machine learning model on the simulated data. 

Predict whether a new simulated image contains a tumor. 

Print the result as "Tumor detected!" or "No tumor detected." 

Requirements: 

Use the following libraries: numpy and sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier. 

Include comments in your code to explain each step. 

Ensure your code is functional and produces the correct output.
